                    Located on four man-made islands in Iskandar Malaysia, “Forest City”
                    is set to be South-East Asia’s largest, mixed use green development.
                    Designed by Sasaki Associates, the master plan has an estimated investment
                    of S$58.3 billion (US$40.9 billion) and is expected to bring around 220,000
                    jobs to the area. Located near the economic centers of Southeast Asia,
                    the new Forest City is ideally placed to become a hub of commerce and culture.
                    Designed to encourage live/work culture, it is composed of “financial institutions,
                    high-tech research and development facilities, headquarter offices,
                    and a variety of creative industries that establish an innovative
                    and sustainable employment base for the region,” write the architects.<br>

                <p>
                    The development strategy involves both a mixed-used, walkable approach,
                    along with a “symbiotic relationship” between the built and natural environments.
                    The development will be connected to the larger region via a light rail and ferry,
                    linking to planned extensions of Singapore and Malaysia’s transit infrastructure.

                <p>
                    A key portion of the aforementioned “symbiotic relationship” is the development’s
                    preservation strategy. Addressing concerns of affecting the area's delicate
                    ecosystem and the fishing industry that relies on it, the design will mimic
                    the natural coastal ecologies of the region at the island edges,
                    re-establishing over nine kilometers of mangroves, 10 kilometers of shallow coves
                    and mudflats and protecting 250 hectares of shallow-water seagrass.
                    In addition to maintaining the region’s ecological sustainability,
                    this restoration also provides resiliency against sea-level rises.                            </p>
