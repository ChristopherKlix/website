                    In 2033, humanity will start its first journey beyond what is known.
                    Onboard will be the first humans to hopefully take their first step onto the red planet, Mars.<br>
                    Planting the trees for future generations, propelling society to the next level.

                    What will you've achieved by then? What are your dreams you are working so hard on? For most of us,
                    space travel and settling on Mars is nothing more than rocket-science, pun intended.
                    But what Alyssa Carson, callsign BLUEBERRY, said on her plenary speech at BBYO IC 2018
                    made me realize that there are people out there, who understand the importance of space travel,
                    people who are like me, who understand me.

                    Almost like a secret door had open up that always had been there but was hidden behind what
                    some parts of conventional society screw up.
                    Have you ever wondered, what it would feel like to stand on the surface of Mars, looking for planet earth?<br>
                    How it would be possible to create a society on a planet so far away from our origins.<br>
                    I did. And many others as well. We are a new society, whose goal it is to settle on a new planet.<br>
